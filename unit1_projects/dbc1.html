<h1>Hello, World!</h1>

<p>Since I learned <strong> bridge </strong> in college 50 years ago, all my memories of the use of strong suit are bridge-colored, and it makes perfect sense as a metaphor. Indeed, a familiarity with the actual source of a metaphor -- in this case, table talk, and the strategies and tactics that it typically <em> accompanies -- can make for a more nuanced </em> understanding on occasion, I think.</p>


<h2>Hello, World2!</h2>

<p>When you are satisfied with your page, you can select all text in the
textarea and copy it to a new text file, with an extension of
either <em>.htm or .html</em>, depending on your %0A Operating System.
This file can then be moved to your Web server.</p>

<h3>Hello, World3!</h3>

<p>Everybody's language experience is different, so That's not my strong suit would be a transparent metaphor from a card game like bridge or whist to anyone <strong> familiar </strong> with those %0A games, calculably understandable by others from the sense of %0A strong alone, and probably incomprehensible to still others. There is no single word that describes all of these attributes, sorry; in fact, that's a lot to expect of one word.</p>
