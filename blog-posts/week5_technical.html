<strong>The use of Classes for a social networking site</strong>

</p>




<p id="second">
A big part of a social networking site is probably the use of classes to define member objects. For example, I would expect each person to be an
instance of a "member" class which contains methods that allow you to add a blog, remove a blog, add a connection, remove a connection, email to
a connection, access your account settings, open a chat box, etc. etc. What I would definitely like to add on my site is a better search 
functionality. I find that the search functions on current social networking sites don't allow one to search based on individual criteria within
each instance of a member. If I want to find all the members who state on their profile that they are blackbelts in Karate, that would be nice to 
know. It would also be nice to categories contacts instead of having a generalized contact repository. So a member instance could have methods that create
folders that keep contacts of customizeable characteristics.
