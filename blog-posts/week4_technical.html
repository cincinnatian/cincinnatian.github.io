<strong>The use of the enumerable cycle in ruby</strong>

</p>




<p id="second">
Cycle allows one to cycle through a set of statement indefinitely, or when an argument is passed, that many times through the argument. I could see how this could be useful in a scenario where you want a game to play until the player gets a correct answer. For example, if you have a game where there are three boxes covering
three colored balls, one being black and two being white, with the object that the player needs to guess which box has the black ball, then you can have a cycle function which compares the player's guess to the actual location of the black ball, and then if the player guessed wrong, the game could start over again with the help of "cycle" where the ball is randomly placed in a different box. If the player guesses correctly, the game can "break"
