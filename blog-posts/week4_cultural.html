One problem facing the tech world is the lack of qualified software engineers. This was an unforeseen consequence of the increased demand for these skills secondary to the tech boom of the 1990s which blossomed into an international growth industry with all kinds of manifestations. It is also a reflection of the lack of skilled workers in general in the United States which most would agree is due to the educational structure that is currently in place. Formal secondary and later education has become very out of touch with what is needed in society and it has left the USA with huge skills gap. Given the increased technological capability of this economy there are a lot of solutions that can yet be implemented. One that has been implemented in software is coding bootcamps, such as Dev Bootcamp. Other online educational institutions have filled in the gaps for various other fields such as psychiatry, management, etc. The next wave of improved, lower cost education can come in the more traditional fields such as medicine and law. Law has already moved in that direction. Medicine has the capability of being moved to some degree in that direction as well.
