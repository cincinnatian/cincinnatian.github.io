<strong>What is rails?</strong>

</p>




<p id="second">
I chose this question because that is what DevBootcamp intends to emphasize. However, even after reading about it, I still cannot fully appreciate what Rails really is. I understand that it is a web application software based on Ruby that makes web development easier to do. Supposedly it is very intuitive and makes web site development more straightforward and fun because it makes assumptions about the best ways to do things. I don't know what kind of assumptions it makes or how it makes them. I look forward to learning what this means during the next several weeks at Dev Bootcamp!
