<strong>Dynamic vs static typed languages</strong>

</p>




<p id="second">
Dynamic typed languages are those where variables are defined when they called and implemented later... they don't have to be declared as an integer, array, etc. Static typed languages are those where the variables have to be declared as a certain type and they remain static. The Dynamic type is used in Ruby and it is useful because it keeps the code more precise and readable which is the entire objective of Ruby. Also, if the input to a function can be either a string or an int, for example, it allows more flexibility in the code so you don't have to think about the circumstance of testing the type of the variable.
