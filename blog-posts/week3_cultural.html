My thinking style is Abstract sequential. According to what I researched on the subject I learn better when I work alone. While this is generally true for me, I've found that over the years, I found many benefits to working in groups and have found advantages of working in groups that I could not have on my own. I do tend to analyze situations from several different view points before making a decision which makes me slow to react at times. Sometimes I even overthink situations. I think the hardest part of DBC for me that seems to be consistent with the thinking style is getting things done in an orderly, timely fashion. While I generally have met the deadlines for tasks, pulling the assignments efficiently from multiple sources was fairly time-consuming and though I am growing more comfortable with it, I prefer having all things clearly written down in one place.

As far as the growth versus thinking mindset, I definitely see the advantages of learning things in multiple formats to solidify knowledge. It reminds of a philosophy my high school biology teacher had. He said that if you see something, write something, hear something, then talk about something, you use 4 different senses and hence have four different ways to remember new information. Also, as growth allows for ideas to build upon ideas while thinking mindset is geared more towards a static understanding, the growth mindset offers the capacity to adapt and expand creativity. The main technological improvements in history have been due to having a creative growth mindset.
