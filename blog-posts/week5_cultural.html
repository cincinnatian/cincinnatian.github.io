	Pairing was at times fun and helpful and at other times not so much. I think that there is enough variability in the ways people
	code that at times trying to view someone else's code becomes somewhat of a chore if they followed a completely different approach.
	I would concede that it probably does make you learn the material better. I enjoyed the coding sessions I have had thus far but
	usually have a hard time knowing whether or not I'm impinging on someone else's desire to drive. Even when asking I don't know
	for sure that that is what they want as I have read my feedback. It was difficult to give negative feedback to my pair because
	I don't know their background enough to tell them how they can improve or to know why they made the mistakes that they made or 
	really if their mistakes weren't mistakes at all but just a thought process they were going through. This is why these feedback
	mechanisms don't seem to be totally useful to me yet.
