## Release 2: Select a value
Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you. 

Knowledge is one of the most important value words I saw in the list above. The way I think about it is that knowledge gives you options. If you had a major problem, you might think that money would give you
the exit from that problem. Though it may do so, having a flexible knowledge base about this particular problem might allow you to use
your creativity to come up with more economical and efficient solution.

## Release 3: Values in your Life
Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:

In general, I try to live up to these values:

4 Agree

## Release 4: Advice
What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?

I think I went over ruby logic with nested while loops.

## Release 5: Values and Stereotype threat
How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it? 

It can since we live in a world where knowledge is ubiquitous and no one has a monopoly on knowledge. The way you apply that knowledge is dependent on your personal abilities, outlook, and background. Most importantly, the way facts are perceived may differ from person to person allowing one to have an individualized understanding of a concept, which mediates sterotype threat.

Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC? 

Keeping a broad perspective. Life is short. Some people in the world have much better lives, and some people have much worse lives. But in the end everything ends. And while a limitation of life might be that joy is transient, an advantage is that pain is also transient.
