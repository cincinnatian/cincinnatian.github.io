Margin is the distance an element has to be from an adjacent element. So, if the margin of an element on the top is 50 pixels, There must be 50 px of space above the element before another element should be able to reside. *It is important to remember that if that element above has a margin of 70 px, there will 70 px of space between the top and bottom element. The greater of the two corresponding margins is the one that manifests. 

Padding, on the other hand, is the distance between the border of an element and the content within it. So if there is an image with a padding of 10px from the top within a div, the image will be 10px from the top border of that element.
