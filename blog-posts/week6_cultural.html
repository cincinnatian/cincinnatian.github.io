Stereotype threat in minority students provides an irrational idea to these students that they have a lower ability to succeed based on their ethnic background. 
Of course, it is non-factual that this is the case; however, due to the history of conquest and colonialism and the history of the spread of information from
the printing press and on, certain inaccurate ideas have unfortunately become fixed in the human psyche.

Society needs to look no further than molecular biology and genetics to understand that the sterotypes that have been applied to certain students should be 
ignored. Human beings are more than 99% identical in the genetic code that defines our current status. If the genetic status that defines each of us is so similar, 
what can be the reason why we see so many differences between each other in the realm of achievement? There are some differences, but they don't have anything to 
do with the inherent potential of each individual. Environment accounts for a much bigger cause of the deviation of our achievement. If we are constantly told 
that we are going to fail, they the likelihood of failure increases. If we are told the opposite, the opposite has a higher likelihood or at least gives the 
ability to recover from failure. 

Additionally, if we were just to examine our history over the past 20000 years, several great people thrived in various parts of the world. These people were of 
various ethnicities, genders, etc. To say any one type of people have a monopoly on achievement is an idiology recognized by those who think rationally as something that is based on fallacious thinking.
