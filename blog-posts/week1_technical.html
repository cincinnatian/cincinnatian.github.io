"Google, Amazon, and WebMD each provide different strengths in terms of their visual appeal, content and function. While Amazon and WebMD are really overpopulated with information on their homepage, Google has its now iconic simple search bar with a daily change around the title kind of as a watercooler conversation starter. While Google provides minimal advertising on the home page, targeted advertising is key to the company. Amazon and WebMD are somewhat overcrowded with information."

"Though Amazon and WebMD are overcrowded, I buy more from Amazon because it has just about everything. WebMD is used as an information source and the products they sell are supplements and such which I think the consumer is not willing to buy outside of a pharmacy to the same extent as other consumer products on a broad-based department store such as Amazon.com"
