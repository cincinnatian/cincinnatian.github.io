A big part of reason why I wanted to be a part of a bootcamp such as Dev Bootcamp is that I will be surrounded by individuals who are motivated to learn software engineering and to build hopefully long-lasting friendships and contacts. It seems to me that regardless of your knowledge base, the contacts and friends that you develop in your career have way more impact on your professional growth than anything else. So, I do enjoy the collaborative aspect of the course. If I just wanted to pursue software engineering, I could have easily pursued one of the many online software engineering courses or MOOCs. There is way more value to me in the people that I will be surrounded by. I also know that even if the other members of the cohort may be way better than me at the technical aspects of software engineering, my diversified knowledge base may very well provide me with ideas that the rest of the cohort can help me bring from concept to life.
