1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
	I was subletting a room several years ago from an elderly couple. I had sent the rent, but they claimed that I had not sent the ren
	I received a nasty voice mail from the elderly gentleman that I had not paid the rent. I sent him a nasty voice mail in response that I
	did. I probably did not have to respond with any nastiness. This was an elderly individual and it's wiser to practice patience. If he 
	had some health issue, then my response could have exacerbated whatever the issue was.
2. What was the source of the conflict?
	payment of rent.
3. How did you handle that conflict?
	I responded in kind.
4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
	Probably worse, though I have no confirmation.
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
	I would have shown restraint and kindness. I should have tried to put myself in the shoes of the elderly gentleman.
6. What did you learn from this experience?
	I have a tendency to feel guilty real easily, and in turn have learned to be as nice as possible so I don't feel guilty.
