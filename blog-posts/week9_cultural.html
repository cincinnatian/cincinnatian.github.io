<p id="first">
I did not ask many question on Google+. I did ask some questions during week one with the setup. I thought my questions were clear, it's just that I have been
using a pc, and no one else that replied had been doing the same. It made a little difficult for them to understand my problem and for me to understand their solution. Ultimately, though I like the ability to ask questions on the google+ site, I did not like the varied amounts of time that I could receive a response. When I start working on a project, I like to get through a problem I'm having right away. I find that if I could not find answers through google search, stack overflow, w3 schools, or other sites, then I would just take a shot-gun trial and error approach to get things working. It's not super efficient, but when you log
on when no one is online and you want a quick answer it's often the only way to do anything
